Would be nice to clean up the dot files
Would be nice to directly use the factorio files instead of local copies
- On Windows 11, Factorio's app data is stored in Program Files (x8)\Steam\steamapps\common\Factorio
- Recipes are in Factorio\data\base\prototypes\recipe.lua
- Mining (need to add) is in Factorio\data\base\prototypes\entity\resources.lua
- Icon files are in Factorio\data\base\graphics

I've done some cropping to get the highest res icon, which are stored in data/icons-cropped. Graphviz's HTML tables do not support CSS clipping so the icons will need to be cropped before hand. Should put them in a tmp directory

Eventually it would be nice to have this as an app, being able to add modules, change the machine.
Would like to update the node images to match factoriocheatsheet soon, the way data is displayed isn't good: https://factoriocheatsheet.com/#common-ratios

Need to add that chemical processing stuff back in soon, would be good to have. Everything has a specific path except where to get the heavy oil, light oil, or petroleum gas so maybe that should be considered a raw ingredient, stick to a specific recipe path, or make a configurable
Data structures are currently weak. WOuld be nice to represent Factorio's DAG in a more universal way.
Some of the icons don't match up. Fision reactor, fluids, etc.
